# Automatic-Titration-Simulator
An interactive automatic titration simulator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that demonstrates the titration process in a virtual environment. The simulator visually represents reagent addition, volume changes, and endpoint detection through color change, allowing users to understand titration principles without physical lab equipment.
