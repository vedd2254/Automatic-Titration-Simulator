# Automatic-Titration-Simulator                         🔗 Live Demo: https://vedd2254.github.io/Automatic-Titration-Simulator/
An interactive automatic titration simulator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that demonstrates the titration process in a virtual environment. The simulator visually represents reagent addition, volume changes, and endpoint detection through color change, allowing users to understand titration principles without physical lab equipment.                     
Designed as a browser-based educational tool, it runs entirely on the client side and requires no external libraries or setup. This project is suitable for students, educators, and anyone looking to explore analytical chemistry concepts through simulation.
